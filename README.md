A server and modified client for Platform Racing 1 that allows players to connect to a specified address instead of one of Jiggmin's original three servers (that are no longer being hosted).

At the moment the code is fairly messy, but it should suffice for now. Awaiting a complete re-write starting from my socket server project.
